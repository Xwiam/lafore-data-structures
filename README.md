# lafore-data-structures
I'm teaching myself some computer science using "Data Structures & Algorithms in Java" 2nd Edition by Robert Lafore.

These are my answers to the end-of-chapter projects.

Note: Each project(s) in a .java file is independent of the other files. Projects use nested classes to allow different projects to use the same class names within one repositry.
